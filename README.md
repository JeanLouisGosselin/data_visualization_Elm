# data_visualization_Elm
This is the data visualization coursework I did in my final year at City, University. The program is written in Elm/Vega-Lite. The program not only offers a solution to viewing certain health habits within the OECD in the past 15 years but also explains the choice of techniques to visualize this specific data.
